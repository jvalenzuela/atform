Introduction
============

The testgen software is intended for writing test procedures, which often
requires significant repitition, iteration, or other similar
time-consuming and error-prone tasks where computers excel.
This software employs the Python programming language to help alleviate
these burdens, such as formatting and
ensuring consistency across duplicate material, freeing the author to focus
on content.

While the test author will need to write what are in fact small Python
programs to use this system, no previous experience with Python or
other programming language is required.
Only elementary Python knowledge is needed to use the testgen package,
much of which can be gleaned from the examples in this guide.
Furthermore, Python's popularity means a wealth of information is
available online, all of which will be directly
applicable as testgen is a normal Python package, and does not alter or
limit the language in any way.
