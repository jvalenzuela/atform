Docstring Format
================

Docstrings for items accessible via the public API shall be in Google
Style. This style was chosen to yield the best results in not only the
manual as formatted by Sphinx, but also IDE calltips. Some IDEs
can display formatted docstrings, while others simply dislay plain text;
the Google style renders the best results in both cases.
